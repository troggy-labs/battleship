# Battleship Game - Claude Development Notes

This is a comprehensive multiplayer Battleship game implementation based on the requirements document.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Framer Motion + Socket.io Client
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + OpenAI API
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Render.com

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with client, server, and shared code
2. **Shared Types**: TypeScript definitions shared between client and server
3. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time game state synchronization
4. **Component Architecture**: Modular React components with CSS Modules
5. **State Management**: Custom hooks with React Context (no Redux needed)

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test coverage including:
- **Backend**: Game logic, matchmaking, WebSocket handlers
- **Frontend**: Components, hooks, user interactions
- **Integration**: End-to-end game flow testing

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Development (runs both client and server)
npm run dev

# Individual services
npm run dev:client    # Client only (port 3000)
npm run dev:server    # Server only (port 3001)

# Testing
npm test              # All tests
npm run test:client   # Client tests only
npm run test:server   # Server tests only

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Core Gameplay**
- Standard Battleship rules (5 ships: 5,4,3,3,2 squares)
- 10x10 game board
- Turn-based shooting with 60s timer
- Hit/miss/sunk detection
- Win condition handling

✅ **Multiplayer**
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Simple queue-based matchmaking (FIFO)
- Reconnection support (60s timeout)
- Session persistence

✅ **UI/UX**
- Mobile-responsive design
- Drag-and-drop ship placement
- Click-to-place alternative
- Explosive animations (Framer Motion)
- Visual feedback for all actions

✅ **Background Generation**
- DALL-E integration for unique game backgrounds
- Fallback to stock images
- PopCap Games aesthetic style

✅ **Technical Features**
- TypeScript throughout
- Error handling and validation
- Connection status monitoring
- Game state persistence
- Cleanup mechanisms

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- `GameBoard`: Interactive grid with animations
- `ShipPlacement`: Drag-drop ship positioning
- `GameTimer`: Turn timer with visual urgency
- `ConnectionStatus`: Real-time connection monitoring
- `GameOverScreen`: Final results with ship reveals

### Backend Services
- `GameLogic`: Core game rules and validation
- `GameService`: Game state management
- `MatchmakingService`: Player queue handling
- `BackgroundService`: DALL-E integration
- `SocketHandlers`: WebSocket event processing

### Custom Hooks
- `useWebSocket`: WebSocket connection management
- `useGameState`: Game state and player management
- `useShipPlacement`: Ship positioning logic
- `useGameTimer`: Turn timer functionality
- `useLocalStorage`: Persistent data storage

## Testing Highlights

- **Game Logic**: Ship placement validation, shot processing, win conditions
- **Matchmaking**: Queue management, player pairing, cleanup
- **Components**: User interactions, animations, responsive behavior
- **Hooks**: State management, WebSocket handling, timer functionality

## Deployment Configuration

### Render.com Setup
- `render.yaml` configured for automatic deployment
- Environment variable management
- Production build optimization
- Static file serving

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For background generation (optional)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode
- `PORT`: Server port (auto-detected on Render)
- `CLIENT_URL`: Client URL for CORS (auto-detected)

## Performance Considerations

1. **WebSocket Optimization**: Efficient event handling and cleanup
2. **Memory Management**: Game cleanup after inactivity
3. **Mobile Performance**: Optimized animations and touch handling
4. **Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking and code splitting
5. **Background Loading**: Async image generation with fallbacks

## Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**: All game moves validated server-side
2. **CORS Configuration**: Proper origin restrictions
3. **Rate Limiting**: Turn timers prevent spam
4. **Session Management**: Temporary sessions, no persistent auth
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- No spectator mode (listed as stretch goal)
- No persistent user accounts
- No game history/statistics
- No sound effects
- Single game room (no private rooms)

### Potential Enhancements
- AI opponents for single-player mode
- Tournament/ranking system
- Voice chat integration
- Custom ship arrangements
- Power-ups and special weapons
- Game replays

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers**: Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+, Edge 88+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 88+
- **WebSocket support**: Required (all modern browsers)
- **ES2020+ features**: Used throughout (transpiled for older browsers)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a multiplayer Battleship game that can be easily extended with additional features.
